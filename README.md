# TinCAN-RP2040-CAN-Simulator-Bench

## What does "TinCAN" do?
  This project allows you to boot modules from modern vehicles such as the SYNC 3 and SYNC 4 modules on a "bench". This is done by simulating the canbus network of the vehicle using an inexpensive($20-30) RP2040 Canbus Board.

## What's the point?
  At the time there is no existing project to power/boot SYNC 4 models and/or newer(2020+) modules. There also isn't a compact user friendly option to do so.

## What's the goal?
  The goal is to build the ultimate DIY bench harness. Thing like modular development board trays, modular bench harnesses, multiple options for power such as Barrel Jacks, USB Type C, etc...
